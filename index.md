# Welcome to My Makers Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm Gerald Thomas, but most people just call me Tripp. I'm a passionate maker and creator from Los Gatos High School. I love building things that satisfy my creative aspirations. My interests span various fields, including electronics, programming, 3D printing, and hardware. While many of my projects incorporate these various disciplines, I focus my interest mainly on Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering ventures. Explore my projects below to see what I've been working on.

## [RC Foam Airplane](./plane.md)
**TLDR:** This plane was one of my first large-scale projects. It took me months to get right, but it introduced me to the engineering experience, and I fell in love. I came up with the design on my own, integrating foam board with some RC parts, and after many iterations, I got it to fly. It was incredibly exciting for me, and even more so for my father, who filmed all my attempts. 

## [Custom RC Car with Robotic Claw](./car.md)
**TLDR:** I built this car at a local program over the Summer, the claw itself was not too bad, but creating the car was very hard as I had limited part options, and then integrating the two posed the largest challenge. However, I loved the experience and program so much that I landed a paid internship at the company the following Summer. 

## [3D Printed Model Rocket](./rocket.md)
**TLDR:** This project was a blast. It was a truly from scratch design. I 3D printed almost every part; if it wasn't 3D printed, it came from some leftover junk in my garage. The only ordered part of the rocket was the engine itself. The creativity and innovation I had to use to make this project a success truly made it one of my most favorite engineering ventures.

## [Custom Drone](./drone.md)
**TLDR:** Like many of my projects, this idea started as an ambitious idea that became a whole adventure. I built this drone out of leftover parts and some I ordered online. Every milestone truly felt like an accomplishment as I just kept adding more features and my vision just kept getting grander and grander.
